# XRAY

XRay is a tool for network OSINT gathering, its goal is to make some of the initial tasks of information gathering and network mapping automatic.

## How Does it Work?

XRay is a very simple tool, it works this way:

1. It'll bruteforce subdomains using a wordlist and DNS requests.
2. For every subdomain/ip found, it'll use Shodan to gather open ports and other intel.
3. For every unique ip address, and for every open port, it'll launch specific banner grabbers and info collectors.
4. Eventually the data is presented to the user on the web ui.

**Grabbers and Collectors**

* **HTTP** `Server`, `X-Powered-By` and `Location` headers.
* **HTTP** and **HTTPS** `robots.txt` disallowed entries.
* **HTTPS** certificates chain.
* **HTML** `title` tag.
* **DNS** `version.bind.` and `hostname.bind.` records.
* **MySQL**, **SMTP**, **FTP**, **SSH**, **POP** and **IRC** banners.

## Notes

**Shodan API Key**

The [shodan.io](https://www.shodan.io/) API key parameter ( `-shodan-key KEY` ) is optional, however if not specified, no service fingerprinting will be performed and a lot less information will be shown (basically it just gonna be DNS subdomain enumeration).

**Anonymity and Legal Issues**

The software will rely on your main DNS resolver in order to enumerate subdomains, also, several connections might be directly established from your host to the computers of the network you're scanning in order to grab banners from open ports. Technically, you're just connecting to public addresses with open ports (and **there's no port scanning involved**, as such information is grabbed indirectly using Shodan API), but you know, someone might not like such behaviour.

If I were you, I'd find a way to proxify the whole process ... #justsaying

## Building a Docker image

To build a Docker image with the latest version of XRay:

    git clone github.com/evilsocket/xray
    cd xray
    docker build -t xraydocker .

Once built, XRay can be started within a Docker container using the following:

    docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 xraydocker xray -address 0.0.0.0 -shodan-key shodan_key_here -domain example.com 

## Manual Installation

Make sure you are using **Go >= 1.7**, that your installation is working properly, that you have set the `$GOPATH` variable and you have appended `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

Then:

    go get github.com/evilsocket/xray
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/evilsocket/xray/
    make get_glide
    make install_dependencies
    make build

If you see errors regarding a missing `go-bindata` binary, try the following and then `make build` again:

    go get -u github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/...

You'll find the executable in the `build` folder.

## Usage

    Usage: xray -shodan-key YOUR_SHODAN_API_KEY -domain TARGET_DOMAIN
    Options:
      -address string
            IP address to bind the web ui server to. (default "127.0.0.1")
      -consumers int
            Number of concurrent consumers to use for subdomain enumeration. (default 16)
      -domain string
            Base domain to start enumeration from.
      -port int
            TCP port to bind the web ui server to. (default 8080)
      -session string
            Session file name. (default "<domain-name>-xray-session.json")
      -shodan-key string
            Shodan API key.
      -wordlist string
            Wordlist file to use for enumeration. (default "wordlists/default.lst")

Example:

    # xray -shodan-key yadayadayadapicaboo... -domain fbi.gov
